I am a CS student and software developer. I plan on working for the [Redacted Government Agency] for atleast a Summer internship and apply to Apple, Google, or SpaceX upon graduation. This is my current list of preferred employers that is subject to change over the next three years of my time at DSU, however, if I fail to gain employment from any selected organization, I plan on becoming self-employed and starting my own company.


Here is my LinkedIn for further inquiries.
